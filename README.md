# EVE ADM Bot

This is a discord bot which will collect alliance system ADM's daily and provide commands to display them in a convenient tier list.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### From PyPI
```shell
# 1. Set up environment
export DISCORD_TOKEN=your-token-here
export DISCORD_CHANNEL=your-channel-here
export DISCORD_APP_ID=your-app-id-here
export ALLIANCE_ID=your-alliance-id-here

# 2. Install package from PyPI
pip install pydisadm

# 3. Run Bot
python -m pydisadm
```

### From source
```shell
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/agelito/adm-bot
cd adm-bot

# 2. Copy and edit .env
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Install dependencies
poetry install

# 4. Run bot
poetry run python pydisadm/__main__.py
```

## üìÉ Commands

- `/adm summary` - send a summary of ADM's
- `/adm csv` - send a csv of ADM's
- `/adm history <name>` - send a graph showing system, constellation, or region ADM over time
- `/adm refresh` - manually refresh the data
- `/adm update <system> <adm>` - manually update ADM for system
- `/adm recommend` - recommend a system to raise ADM in

## üîß Configuration
Configuration is done using environment variables or `dotenv`. See `.env.example` for example configuration.

- `DISCORD_TOKEN` - the token bot should use when communicating with discord.
- `DISCORD_CHANNEL` - the channel name bot should listen too, if this is empty the bot will listen to all channels.
- `DISCORD_APP_ID` - the bot application ID
- `ALLIANCE_ID` - the alliance ID for collecting ADM values, only systems owned by this alliance will be collected.

## üîç Caveats
* The ADM data from ESI is only updated once a day, so refreshing more often than that is not necessary.
* The database will continue to fill up with historic entries, manually inspect size and purge older entries if it's too big.
